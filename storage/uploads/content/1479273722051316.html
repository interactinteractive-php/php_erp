<p>Projects Abroad accepts applications on a rolling basis, so <strong>there is no fixed deadline for your application</strong>. However, we encourage you to apply as early as possible once you have decided what you want to do and when you want to leave. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some destinations and projects require at least three months to process an application, arrange for visas, and advise you properly on how to prepare. Other countries can be processed in <a href="http://www.projects-abroad.org/volunteer-abroad-last-minute/">as little as three weeks</a>.</li>
<li>Having more time to prepare makes it easier for you to <a href="http://www.projects-abroad.org/how-it-works/fundraising/">fundraise</a>, and for us to advise you on preparations for your trip. It also gives you time to talk to us about tailoring your program to your interests and preferences before you arrive at your placement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you are thinking of traveling, we encourage you to <a href="http://www.projects-abroad.org/apply-now/">apply </a>as far in advance as possible, especially if you are planning on traveling over the summer. To help ensure that your application process goes as smoothly as possibly, please see our <a href="http://www.projects-abroad.org/apply-now/application-tips/">application tips.</a></p>
