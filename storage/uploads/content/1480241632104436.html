<p>Generally speaking, you can start any project on any day. When you <a title="Apply Now" href="http://www.projects-abroad.org/apply-now/">apply</a>, you will specify the start and end dates. Our projects run year round and have volunteers arriving almost every day.</p>

<p>Since our projects sometimes depend on the local holiday calendar, there are brief occasions when normal project work is suspended. For example, schools often close for long winter/summer holidays. During these times, we arrange for alternative work projects that are similar in substance to our ongoing projects, but address the short-term, direct needs of the local communities. For example, during the summer holiday (January &ndash; early March) on our <a title="Peru Teaching program" href="http://www.projects-abroad.org/volunteer-projects/teaching/teach-english-and-other-subjects/volunteer-peru/">Peru Teaching program</a>, volunteers run a teacher training course for local ESL instructors.</p>
<p>If you would like to arrange your start and end dates around the local holidays, please call us at 1.888.839.3535 or email us at <a title="info@projects-abroad.org" href="mailto:info@projects-abroad.org">info@projects-abroad.org</a>. In addition, you will also have the opportunity, after you are accepted into the program, to speak with a staff member about local holidays.</p>
