<p>The backbone of our program structure is MyProjectsAbroad. Every volunteer gets access to this proprietary database upon acceptance into a Projects Abroad program. (If you are an accepted volunteer, you can <a title="www.myprojectsabroad.org" href="http://www.myprojectsabroad.org/" rel="NOFOLLOW">login here</a>.)</p>
<p>You should login to MyProjectsAbroad as soon as you are accepted, and check back occasionally as you prepare for your trip. We will email you each time that we place new information on your MyProjectsAbroad profile.</p>
<h3>Emergency and Local Contact Details</h3>
<p>Phone numbers, email addresses and office locations for on-the-ground support staff are available on MyProjectsAbroad. From the first time you login, you will know: who are our staff are in-country, where to find them, and how to get help in an emergency.</p>

<p>About a month before your placement starts, we will post a profile of your project. (We do not give this earlier because, often when third parties are involved, details change.) This profile will include photos, the name and contact information of your on-site supervisor, location and background information on your project, as well as a summary of your role as a volunteer.</p>
